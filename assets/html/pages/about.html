                <p>problem</p>
                <p>In most of the engineering colleges in India, out of the few available electronics lab equipments many are faulty and doesn't work properly. This creates hinderance in students' learnings and practical knowledge. When we tried to find the reason, we came to know that these faulty devices are not being replaced by new ones mainly because of their high costs. And since students are not very much interested in electronics experiments hence the authorities also don't care about these faulty devices that much.</p>

                <p>Solution:Techweb Trioscope</p>
                <p>TechWeb Triscope is an all-in-one web based lab deice which includes the functionalities of three most commonly used devuces in electronics experiments: Oscilloscope, Function Generator and Multimeter. This device is specifically designed for students of electronics engineering by keeping in mind their curriculum in India. Our device would use this website for giving inputs to hardware components and also showing the output waveforms and its different parameter on this interface. The key feature of this device is that its very cost-effective making it very affordable for students and this web-interface makes it more interesting and easy to use.&nbsp;</p>
